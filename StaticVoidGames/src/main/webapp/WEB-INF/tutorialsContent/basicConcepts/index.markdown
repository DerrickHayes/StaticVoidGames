This section covers the basics: functions, variables, and if statements. These
are important concepts that programmers use every day, so it's important to
have a solid understanding of how they work.

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a simple but useful base that you can
use to build many types of games from. Don't be afraid to experiment! Use the
all of the example code in these tutorials along with the [Processing
API](http://processing.org/reference/) to play around and get interesting
results! That's the best way to learn, so I suggest stopping for at least a
few minutes and modifying each example to see what happens. These tutorials
are meant as a starting step- actually diving in is up to you.
