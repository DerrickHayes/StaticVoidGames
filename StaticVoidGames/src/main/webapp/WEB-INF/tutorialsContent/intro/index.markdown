# Intro to Programming

These tutorials are designed for people who have little or no programming
experience, but even skilled programmers might benefit from going over the
basics again. These tutorials start by going over the fundamentals of how a
computer works and what programming entails. I think it's a good idea to be
familiar with this stuff before diving into programming, so I recommend
spending a day or so reading over this before you go onto the other tutorials
(which are coming soon!).

After the basics, I get into a discussion on what makes Java different, what
makes Processing different, the basics of how each one works, and our
motivation for choosing these languages to learn programming. Finally, I'll
introduce you to your first program, then talk about where to go from there.

I'm still new to writing tutorials, so feel free to [contact

corrections, criticisms, or suggestions!
