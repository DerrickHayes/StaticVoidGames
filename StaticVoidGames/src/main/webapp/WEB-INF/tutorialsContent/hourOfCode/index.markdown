##Hour of Code

###What is the Hour of Code?

The [Hour of Code](http://code.org/educate/hoc) is a challenge: spend an hour of your time learning how to code. You'd be amazed at what you can accomplish in that amount of time!

The Hour of Code was organized by [Code.org](http://code.org/) as a way to get more people involved in programming- especially people who might not consider themselves "typical" computer scientists. The "official" Hour of Code takes place during [Computer Science Education Week](http://csedweek.org/) in December, but you can try it out any time!

###What is the Static Void Games Hour of Code?

There are plenty of Hour of Code tutorials out there, each one geared towards a slightly different audience. Some of them are for kids, and that's great! But they can also be a little too simple for anyone else. Some of them are in the form of videos, which I find hard to learn from. And some of them leave me with a sense of "what now?" when I'm done.

That's not to say those tutorials are *bad*; it's great that there are tutorials out there for people with different learning styles!

But this is my attempt at organizing an Hour of Code the way I would like to learn- no Disney characters, no boring videos, and plenty of places to go exploring once you're done.

###Who is this for?

I'm designing these for people who have absolutely no prior knowledge of programming. All you need is a little bit of algebra. If you can answer this question:

    X = 36
    Y = 6
    Z = X + Y
    
What does Z equal?

...then you know enough to start.

By the end of this Hour of Code, you'll have coded a fully functional Pong game!

But you don't need to love video games to be a programmer. After this hour, you'll be able to do all sorts of things, like visualizing data or creating computer-generated art.

More importantly, the goal of this Hour of Code is not to **teach you how to code**, but to **teach you how to learn how to code**. That might not make any sense, but the point is that after this hour, it will be up to YOU what you do next.
