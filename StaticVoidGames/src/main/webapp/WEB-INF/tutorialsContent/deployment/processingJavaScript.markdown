## Exporting Processing.js

To upload a [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) sketch on Static Void Games, do the following:

 - Use Processing's JavaScript mode from the Processing editor.
 - Click the "export for web" button.
 - That creates a directory in your sketch folder called web-export.
 - Create web-export.zip by zipping up that directory.
 - Upload that web-export.zip file on the Processing.js section of the game uploader, and let Static Void Games handle the rest!
