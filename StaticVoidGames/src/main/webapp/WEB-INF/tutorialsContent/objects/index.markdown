#  [Objects](index.jsp)

We've gone over primitive values such as int, double, and boolean. A primitive
holds a _stateless_ value. In other words, you can't carry any extra
information along with a primitive. For example, you can hold a 7 in an int,
but you can't hold a red 7 in one int and a blue 7 in another int.

By contrast, Objects can hold a _state_, where multiple pieces of data are
contained together to define a single piece of information. One example might
be a Point object, which can hold both an x and a y value.

Objects can make your life much easier, since they allow you to store data in
a more logical way. But at a deeper level, thinking in Objects is an important
step in understand languages like Java or Processing, since they are [Object-
oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-
oriented_programming) (OOP) languages.
