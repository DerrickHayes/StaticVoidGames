 - What is Static Void Games?
  - SVG is a site designed to help indie programmers release their games to the public without worrying about boring things like deployment or web development. SVG is also a community with the goal of helping people learn how to become indie developers- not only do we have tutorials, but many of the games here offer their source code for you to check out and learn from.

 - Who is this site built for?
  - People who want to support indie games simply by playing them (thank you!). People who just want to play some random, fun, creative games. Novice programmers who want to learn the basics. Experienced programmers who don't feel like dealing with deployment or web development. Game jammers who need a quick way to upload a game!
 
 - How do I get started learning how to program?
  - Start small. Think Pong instead of Minecraft. Work through the tutorials on this site, which take you from the very basics.
  
 - Will I make money from my games?
  - That's up to you. I'm staying away from paid games, but you can currently specify an advertisement to display on your game's page. You can use something like [Google Adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense) to make money through your advertisement. You keep 100% of that revenue (well, Google probably takes a percentage, but I don't), but you need **a lot** of players before advertisements become profitable.

 - Why Java?
  - Java is one of the most popular languages for intro programming courses (and beyond), so people are already familiar with it. Java already has great support and a great community, and its popularity will only grow as more and more people use Java-enabled mobile devices. Couple that with its easy multi-platform support and a plethora of game/graphic/sound engines, and Java is a fantastic choice for indie game development.

 - Why Processing?
  - Processing is built on top of Java, so it has all of the benefits of Java. But Processing is designed to be highly visual and easy to use, so it fits perfectly with people trying to learn the ropes.

 - But I heard Java was too slow for games?
  - Java got a bad name in its early days because people did not know how to use it. Doing things like tying up the EDT will make a program seem slow or unresponsive, but it doesn't mean that Java is slow. Also, many Java programmers don't have the time to really work on the website surrounding their Java application, which causes people to unfairly dismiss the application based only on what the website looks like, not the actual Java program! People might argue that the JVM causes Java to be slower, but on modern machines, that's basically a non-issue. In fact, the perks you get from Java's memory management, JIT compiler, ease of maintainability, etc. far outweigh any "costs" accrued. For more information, give this a read: [Java Performance - Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_performance).

 - Why not flash / C / C++ / C# / lisp / whitespace / game maker?
  - There are plenty of other websites devoted to games done in flash or game maker. Plus I wanted to focus on programming without worrying about deployment or web development, and the best way I know to do that is by using Java. We do support packaged executables though, and I'm hoping to add support for html5 and javascript games in the future, mostly because you can export libGDX and Processing games that way as well.

 - Something isn't working, what should I do?
  - Feel free contact me with any problems you have, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

 - How should I use the source other people have posted?
  - Take a look at the legal page for a high-level overview, and consult the individual game page or contact the developer for specifics. But basically, you should feel free to learn from other people's source, but don't just copy and paste it into your code (unless the developer says you can). A general rule of thumb is: if I can tell that a feature in your game is directly from a different game, you're probably doing something wrong. For example, say you see a game that has some physics that you like, but you can't figure out how the developer did it. So you take a look at the source. It's okay for you to read through and play around to understand the approach, but it's not okay to simply copy and paste the code so that your game has the exact same physics (changing some constants doesn't count).

 - Do I have to release the source?
  - No. You are encouraged to include the source, but you certainly don't have to if you don't want to.

 - What are my rights?
  - Basically, if you create a game, you own the copyright on that game. By uploading a game, you are giving the general public the right to play that game. Anything else is up to you. See the legal page for more information.

 - Who are you?
  - My name is Kevin Workman. I have a day job as a Java programmer, and I created and maintain this site in my spare time. Feel free to contact me; I'd love to hear from you!

 - Do you make money from this site?
  -  Hahaha. No. This site currently costs me around 50 dollars a month. I do have advertisements, but they usually make less than a dollar a month, plus I'm planning on "reinvesting" that advertising credit back into advertising this site. Although I would love to become rich and famous from this, I'm not doing it for any money.
